A couple of years ago my parents got me a 23andMe kit for my birthday. I decided not to use it, because I thought the government would demand that 23andMe give up my sample if I were to commit a crime.

However, I later decided I don't care. I mean, I don't plan on committing crimes, much less ones that would rise to the level of DNA evidence. However, I also heard that AncestryDNA was more accurate, so I decided I should do it instead.

## The Breakdown

| Ethnicity | Approx. share |
| --------- | ------------- |
| England & Northwestern Europe | 40% |
| Scotland | 33% |
| Wales | 11% |
| Sweden & Denmark | 8% |
| Ireland | 8% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

So basically, the British Isles, and then Sweden and Denmark for some reason.
